# HR-Attrition-Analytics-Project

📌 Project Overview

Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations as it leads to increased recruitment costs, loss of skilled talent, and reduced productivity.
This project focuses on analyzing employee data to identify the key factors influencing attrition and to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the organization using machine learning and data visualization techniques.

🎯 Objective

Analyze HR data to understand employee attrition patterns

Predict employee attrition using a Decision Tree classification model

Identify key drivers of attrition using SHAP explainability

Visualize insights and predictions using Power BI dashboards

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data preprocessing and analysis

Scikit-learn – Machine learning model (Decision Tree)

SHAP – Model explainability

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Visualizations

Power BI

Interactive dashboards

Attrition trends and model prediction visualization

📂 Dataset

IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset

Contains employee details such as age, department, income, job role, overtime, satisfaction levels, and attrition status.

🔄 Steps Involved in Building the Project

Data Collection

Imported HR attrition dataset into Python.

Data Preprocessing

Checked data types and missing values.

Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed attrition trends by department, job role, income, overtime, and satisfaction levels.

Model Building

Trained a Decision Tree Classifier to predict employee attrition.

Model Evaluation

Evaluated the model using:

Accuracy

Classification Report

ROC-AUC Score

Explainability

Used SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) to identify key factors influencing attrition.

Visualization

Created interactive dashboards in Power BI:

HR Overview

Attrition Factors

Model Predictions

SHAP Explainability

📊 Key Insights

Employees working overtime have a higher likelihood of attrition.

Monthly income and job satisfaction strongly influence employee retention.

Employees with fewer years at the company show higher attrition risk.

SHAP analysis provides transparent explanations for model predictions.

✅ Results

Decision Tree model achieved high prediction accuracy.

SHAP explainability helped understand feature contributions.

Power BI dashboards made insights easy to interpret for HR teams.

🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how HR Analytics combined with machine learning and visualization tools can help organizations predict employee attrition and take preventive actions. The solution enables data-driven decision-making to improve employee satisfaction and reduce turnover.
